# Front End Design Elective - Spring 2024

## Overview

Your task is to build a site for our festival called FooFest.

For that purpose, we have a lot of data, but more on that later.

The site is one big site, but you can think of it as two sub-systems.

## System 1, the booking site

[Requirements for the booking site](FORM-REQUIREMENTS.md)

## System 2, the festival app

[Requirements for the festival app](APP-REQUIREMENTS.md)

## The API

The backend team has created a little documentation for you guys.
